# Howzit Keanu

A Flutter project for the Brother Hackathon 2022.

## Mini-Hackathon #3.

Keanu (the “breeze”) rents surfboards and teaches surfing on the island
of Kauai. He always gives free lessons to children. To handle the rentals
and the lessons efficiently, he would love to have an app that can scan
the driver’s licenses to check in and check out and calculate the fee
accordingly.

Can you help Keanu? 

# Brother Hackathon

Feel free to use any of my GitHub repositories in your apps. You should also consider
attending the free Brother Hackathon happening this year. You get a free Brother QL-1110NWB,
a PT-P910BT, and possibly an awesome DS-940DW mobile scanner. Visit brotherhackathon.com for
more information. I will be teaching workshops, and they are free. You can ask me any questions.
Thank you.
